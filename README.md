# Topic-Modeling-NMF
Topic modeling is a technique to extract relevant topics and themes from the collection of documents. One of the way to perform topic modeling is via Non-Negative matrix factorization (NMF). NMF factorizes a non-negative matrix 𝑉of dimensions 𝑛 × 𝑚 into two non-negative  matrices, 𝑊 (𝑛 × 𝑘) and 𝐻(𝑘 × 𝑚) such that,
